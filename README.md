# AI Image Translator
---

## Overview

This project is a web application that extracts text from context-heavy images like Manga and translates it into another language. The system leverages OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and AI translation models leveraged with multi-agent LLM setup to provide accurate translations of text found in images. The translation is then seamlessly inserted into the image, replacing the original text, enhancing readability and user's experience.
